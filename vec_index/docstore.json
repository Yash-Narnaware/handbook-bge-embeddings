IIT Goa, ever since its inception in 2016 has been establishing\nmodern research facilities and extensively expanding its infrastructural facilities have given a\npush for the Ph.D. program which was approved by the Senate of IIT Goa in its \ufb01rst meeting\nitself. The objective of the Ph.D. program is to leave that footprint as envisioned by IIT Goa.\nA Ph.D. degree is awarded as a recognition for the achievements of independent research\nand application of knowledge to the solution of technical and scienti\ufb01c problems. The\nacademic program shall lead to the degree by meeting criteria set by the Senate, IIT Goa. This\nis achieved by securing credits through course-work and research. The admission to the Ph.D.\nprogram is through a centralised process of the institute. Although the students are admitted\nto certain schools, IIT Goa encourages interdisciplinary research. The institute has been\nactively involved in various sponsored projects from government as well as industrial support.\nIIT Goa extends all the facilities for doing path breaking research across all \ufb01elds of science,\ntechnology, humanities and social sciences. The student has access to all facilities within and\noutside the school in which the student is enrolled. The institute has several Memorandum\nof Understanding (MoU) signed with various institutes and national laboratories within India\nand abroad, which allows the student to work elsewhere for part of their research. IIT Goa\ninvites distinguished personalities from different \ufb01elds and also organizes various events\nlike workshops, symposia and conferences. These events encourage the student to engage in\nstimulating discussions which will contribute toward their sound development. IIT Goa also\nextends its support toward non academic development by providing opportunities to explore\ntheir extra-curricular interests through various clubs. Psychological and emotional support\nservices are also provided for the needy students. In other words, IIT Goa extends and tries\nto provide the best possible environment for excelling in the research path chosen by the\nstudent enrolling for the Ph.D. program.\nii", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2626, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e620143e-73f1-475f-b7d6-534c2a2f235c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e620143e-73f1-475f-b7d6-534c2a2f235c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "iii", "file_name": "IIT_Goa_PhD_ManualMar2024.pdf", "file_path": "/content/fol1/IIT_Goa_PhD_ManualMar2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387497, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a70581e1-31c1-46eb-b9bf-647b5e29ee1c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "iii", "file_name": "IIT_Goa_PhD_ManualMar2024.pdf", "file_path": "/content/fol1/IIT_Goa_PhD_ManualMar2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387497, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "5e4bff4e855d1b591d99632cbf01d750f9bcbda0e2db1ec53f67581f1037c25b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7908468f-7c23-42fd-b2d5-cc83656920e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "ii", "file_name": "IIT_Goa_PhD_ManualMar2024.pdf", "file_path": "/content/fol1/IIT_Goa_PhD_ManualMar2024.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 387497, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "1a88d32d5bb74d30db84b360cd4900432369d598c4480d21ef54ff3e8caf4081", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5d0a9ac7-883c-40c2-8149-3f90570ca5ae", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df996737065f4f56b5768ffbeac8fc7c456e52c5f2152adb15017ad425aaaed8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This manual is a guiding document for the fascinating journey the student has decided to\nundertake.

The grades of the two semesters preceding APS will be considered \ufb01nal only\nafter the APS (i.e. it is a provisional grade).

These grades shall not be counted towards the calculation\nof CPI/SPI (Table III.4).\n\u2022For every 3 credits, a grade of S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) may be given.\n3 credits may be equivalent to, but not limited to, 8-10 hours of work per week.\nAlthough, U grade may be counted towards the credit hours, but will not be considered\nfor evaluating the research credits earned during the Ph.D. program. Only S grades\nwill be counted towards the required research credits.\n\u2022The 12 doctoral research credits shall be graded in four sub-units as SSSS, SSSU,\nSSUU, SUUU, UUUU. When a student registers with lower credits, the appropriate\ngrading may be done. For example, if a student registers of 6 credits, the grades may\nbe SS, SU or UU. Similarly, if a student registers for 3 credits, the grade shall be S or\nU.\n\u2022During doctoral research a student must secure a minimum of four S in any two\nconsecutive semesters. If a student fails to secure minimum research credits in any\ntwo consecutive semesters, the case should be referred to SPGC through DC.\n2Overloading of research credits may be considered under the recommendations of PPGC/SPGC on a\ncase-by-case basis.

Credit ( C) hours for a course is computed as follows1\n\u2022For a full semester Lab/Practical only course, i.e., one with zero lecture hours but\npossibly with tutorials, the credit is\nT+\u2308P\n2\u2309\n\u2022Otherwise, i.e., when the course involves lectures, the credit is\nL+T+\u230aP\n2\u230b\n\u2022Credit hours of a half-semester course is half of that of a full semester course with\nsimilar L-T-Pparameters.\nExamples (also, see Table III.1 and Table III.2).\n\u2022A 3-0-0 full semester course with 3 lecture hours per week and no practicals or\ntutorials constitutes 3 credits. A half-semester course with similar parameters carries\n1.5 credits.\n\u2022A standard 3-0-3 full semester course with 3 lecture hours per week and 3 lab hours\nper week carries 4 credits. So does a standard 3-1-0 course with 3 lecture hours per\nweek and 1 tutorial hour per week.\n1Adapted from U.G.

The tenure of faculty members \nis for two years, with half of them retiring each year (or as decided by the department).  \nThe PUGC :   \n\u2022 Advises the students about their curriculum and academic opportunities  \n\u2022 Monitors the progress of academically weak students   \n\u2022 Handles any problem faced by students in their academic Programmes.  \n  \nSenate Undergraduate Committee (SUGC):  This is a standing c ommittee formed by the Senate \nto look after all the issues regarding institute UG Programmes. It makes recommendations to the \nSenate on all academic issues including policy matters and specific problem instances related to \nUG students and UG Programmes. It s constituent s are the conveners of various PUGCs \n(Programme Under Graduate Conveners) where applicable, last SUGC chairperson (ex -officio), \none Senate nominee, and four student representatives nominated by Student body . The \nchairperson is elected by the c onstituent members.  \nOutline of UG Programme  \nB. Tech programme consists of courses in Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, \nEngineering and Technology, and other related topics. The sequence of studies broadly consists \nof four stages.  \nThe first stage is an introduction to the sciences, humanities and technical arts (such as \nworkshops etc.). This is common for all UG Programmes.  \nThe Second stage is the study of engineering courses that emphasizes a broad -based knowledge \nin interdiscipli nary areas which enables the students to appreciate the links between science, \nengineering, and humanities.  \nIn the third stage, the students are exposed to subjects in the chosen areas of study which dwell \non the principles governing the design and which develop in them the ability for physical and \nanalytical modelling , design and development.  \nDuring the final stage, an engineering student studies problems of integrated design with an \nawareness of size, performance, optimization and cost & works independe ntly on a B.Tech. \nProject. Students are thus initiated into the methods of research, Library reference work, use of \nengineering scientific equipment/instruments, learning of modern computational techniques and \nwriting of technical and scientific reports. I n parallel with the last two stages, the student is \nintroduced to the social and economic objectives of the era and to the interaction between man, \nmachine, and nature. This is sought to be achieved through elective courses (to be offered in the \nforthcomin g semesters) in humanities and social sciences and through practical training, \nfieldwork , works -visits and seminars. In addition, students are also made aware of environmental \nissues through an introductory course in environmental science and engineering.  \nThe requirements for degree programme run by the Institute are broadly classified as:  \n(a) Institute Requirements (further divided into C ore courses, Elective Courses and other \nrequirements ).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3482, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "443b4ac2-8346-46c8-a189-cd747f67b2f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "443b4ac2-8346-46c8-a189-cd747f67b2f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "UG_MANUAL-1.pdf", "file_path": "/content/fol1/UG_MANUAL-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1165511, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a215a384-b215-43e6-942b-3306fff4f42f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "UG_MANUAL-1.pdf", "file_path": "/content/fol1/UG_MANUAL-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1165511, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "aa90986535ceaa66d35fd272e2fef4860190337e43915a987e9c1456847bfb41", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "39b1ebcb-0867-4696-b8a5-c9e9deea7896", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "UG_MANUAL-1.pdf", "file_path": "/content/fol1/UG_MANUAL-1.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1165511, "creation_date": "2024-05-01", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-01"}, "hash": "9f4962f33a3a3f94872fbb710526f86af87d0dbf597208900bc7838c6f622cfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b62b0d91-6cce-4135-a950-bb9369fb2d25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f16721833a53c0f69642df8da7d4446fa02a09ed04712ba3cc8345c686389c6d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(b) Departmental Requirements (further divided into Compulsory courses, Elective \ncourses, and other requirements , Projects, Internship and Seminars )   \n  \nAcademic Session  \n  \n1.1 Semester  \n  \nThe Institute follows a specialize d credit -based semester system. The academic session normally \nruns from the end of July in one ye ar to the middle of July in the next year.

In fact, the Faculty Adviser may \nprepare a revised plan of study at a slower pace for students with poor performa nce.  \n3.1.1  Procedure for Registration  \nThe Institute has an offline/online registration system and the registration is normally done on the \nfirst two days of each semester and the summer term. The registration schedule is announced in \nadvance (Academic Calendar). Students should contact their r espective Faculty Advisers for \nconsultation and registration, this involves the selection of courses consistent with the specific \ncredit requirements detailed in the courses of study and subject to the students\u2019 performance in \nthe previous semester.  The a cademic registration process gets completed only after the PUGC  \nconvener/Faculty advisor approves the registration form. A registration is considered valid only if \nthere is no time -table conflict between the courses for which the student has registered.

In any case, \nregistration must be completed on or before the prescribed last date for registration. Students \nhaving outstanding dues to the Institute or h ostel shall not be permitted to register. Late \nregistration may be permitted only for valid reasons and on payment of a late registration fee as \nprescribed from time to time. However, if a student fails to register during any semester, their \nregistration  is liable to be cancelled.  \nStudents having backlog courses are required to register by filling up a Course Registration Form \n(CRF) which will be made available to them by the Academic Section. The CRF will contain all \nthe compulsory courses of the semester  pre-printed. The student should duly complete the CRF, \nget it approved by the faculty adviser and then submit the same to the Academic Section for \nfurther necessary action. The faculty advisor may recommend a reduced load for students with \nbacklogs after considering the regulations as decided by the SUGC.    \n3.1.2  Registration for the first two semesters   \nIn each of the first two semesters of the programme, a student is required to register for all the \ncourses listed in the curriculum for the semester. In a ddition, students who are identified as \nacademically weak at the end of the first Semester may be prescribed a specially worked out \nLoad in consultation with the Faculty Advisor. These students are required to do manual \nregistration.   \nRegistration of a st udent in a course may be cancelled at any stage by the Academic Section, if \nit is found that they does not meet the pre -requisites of the course, or if there is a clash in the \nstudent's time table preventing her/him from attending the course or if it is fo und that s/he is not \neligible to register for that course for any other reason. An instructor of a course may also \nrecommend cancellation of registration of any student in that course for reasons such as absence \nfrom classes without proper authorization. T he instructor may recommend de -registration of such \nstudents up to four weeks prior to the last day of classes. The instructor should send de -\nregistration recommendations to the SUGC Chairperson. The same information should also be \nsent to the concerned PUGC. The SUGC Chairperson's decision in each case shall be conveyed \nto the instructor and the student at least two weeks prior to the last day of classes.   \n 3.1.3  Registration for third and subsequent semesters  \nAs has already been mentioned, students must  regularly register for every semester at its \ncommencement until the completion of their programme.

The SPI is the weighted average of the grade points obtained in all the \ncourses registered by the stud ent during the semester. For example, if a student passes five \ncourses (Theory/labs. /Projects/ Seminar etc.) in a semester with credits C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 \nand her/his grade points in these courses are g1, g2, g3, g4 andg5 respectively, then her/his SPI  \nis equal to:  \n                    C1g1 + C2 g2 + C3 g3 + C4 g4 + C5 g5  \n      SPI =    \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 \u2015\u2015  \n                      C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5  \n  \nThe SPI is calculated to two decimal places. The SPI for any semester will take into consideration \nthe FR grades awarded in that semester. For example, if a student has failed in course 4, the \nSPI will then be computed as:  \n                  C1g1 + C2 g2 +  C3 g3 + C4 * ZERO+C5 g5  \n   SPI =       \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 \u2015\u2015\u2015\u2015 \u2015\u2015  \n                   C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5  \nThe   courses   which   do   not   form   the   minimum   requirement   of   the   degrees   will   not   \nbe   considered   for calculation of the SPI. S uch additional courses undertaken and the grades \nearned by the student will be shown separately.  \n  \n4.5.2  Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)  \nAn up to date assessment of the overall performance of a student from the time s/he entered the \nInstitute is obtai ned by calculating a number called the Cumulative Performance Index, CPI, in a \nmanner similar to the calculation of SPI. The CPI therefore considers all the co urses registered \nby the student towards the minimum requirement of the degree s/he has enrolled f or, since s/he \nentered the Institute.

If the reason for absence at the re -\nexam is not supported by a medical certificate, the II grade awarded will be revised to FR.  \nThus, the II grade gets converted to one of the f ollowing: (i) \u2018DR' (course dropped, as above), (ii) \n\u2018FR' in case of poor performance or unjustified absence, for the re -exam and (iii) a pass grade \ndepending on the student's performance.

A request for re -totalling  must be made by student to Academic office using the \nprescribed form, which will be sent to faculty for further action.

Miscellaneous  \n9.1 Helping weaker students  \nThe students with backlogs will be compulsorily required to register manually. This will require \nthem to meet and discuss with the  faculty adviser. The students with backlogs should \ncontinuously seek help from the faculty adviser, the student counsellor  and also be in constant \ntouch with parents about their performance. The Institute will also communicate to the \nparents/guardians abo ut the performance of their ward semester wise / annually. This is wit h the \nintention that the guardians  of the students having backlogs should be made aware about the \nperformance of their wards and it is expected that they should keep constant touch with the faculty \nadviser and the concerned Head of the Department and if necessary, the student's counsellor .  \n9.2 Faculty Adviser  \nOn joining the Institute, a student or a group of students is/are assigned to a Faculty Adviser. The \nstudents are expected to con sult the faculty adviser on many matters relating to their academic \nperformance and the courses they may take in various semesters/summer terms. The idea of a \nFaculty Adviser has been evolved to extend guidance to the students enabling them to complete \ntheir courses of study for the required degree in a smooth and satisfactory manner. Thus, the \nrole of the Faculty Adviser is of immense importance. The Faculty Adviser is the person to whom \nthe parents/guardians should contact for performance related issues o f their ward. In view of the \nguidance to the students the role of faculty adviser is outlined as below:  \n1. Guidance about the rules and regulations governing the courses of study for a particular \ndegree.  \n2. The faculty adviser registers the students for course s within the scope of the advice \ngiven by the Senate Undergraduate Committee (SUGC) .  \n3. He is also authorized to permit the students to drop/adjust one or more courses for which \nthey may have registered.  \n4. Pay special attention to weak students  \n5. Make revised (unloading/uploading) plan of study for weak/bright students based on \ntheir semester performance.  \n6. Suggest modalities for course/credit requirements for the students recommended for \nexchange Programmes.  \n7. Guidance and liaison with parents of st udents for their performances.  \n9.3 Academic Calendar  \nThe academic activities of the Institute are regulated by Academic Calendar approved by the \nSenate from time to time and made available to the Students/ Faculty members and all other \nconcerned in print ed and/or electronic form. It is mandatory for Students / Faculty to strictly \nadhere to the academic calendar for completion of academic activities.   \n10.
